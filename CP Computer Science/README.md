# Career Path - Computer Science

This is some part of my work as I'm doing the Computer Science Career Path by Codecademy.

Due to the difference in variable names I separate files that were created by me and those that were provided by Codecademy.

## CS101: Introduction to Programming

### Files

This was a simple course that was added around April 2023 by Codecademy. Its a simple course but it gave me new insights on how to import a file. Thus, why I decide to include in my Repository for notes.

### Object Oriented Programming
Here we learn about Classes. In the project hamster.py is where we learn to create a real-life scenario of a pet into a class. I chose hamsters because I have one cute hamster with me <3

We are also to make a game using class and objects. We will use our Hamster class to play Adopt a Hamster!

Files:
* hamster.py
* adopt_hamster.py

### Final Project
I am trying to make a Text Adventure game for the final project. Here I make a simple scenario where user need to buy an ice cream. Each choice will lead to a different path.

Files:
* ice_cream_shop.py

## CS102: Data Structures and Algorithms

The file node.py is provided by Codecademy for this course.

### Node

Nodes are the building blocks of data structure.

Files:

* my_node.py

### Doubly Linked Lists

Doubly linked lists is similar to linked lists. However, the nodes have points for their previous and next node, whereas basic linked lists only have points for the next nodes.

Files:

* doubly_linked_lists.py

### Queues

Queues are data structure that contains an ordered set of data. For this structure we can use linked lists or doubly linked lists.

Files:

* queues.py

### Stacks

It is similar to queues. However, it uses the system FILO (First In, Last Out). Here we also have a small exercise to create a game called Tower of Hanoi that represent the use of stacks.

Files:

* my_stack.py - material about stack that I have done
* stack.py - a file by Codecademy for the Tower of Hanoi project
* tower_of_hanoi.py

### Hash Maps

An action where we turn strings into numerical number. Where if we look the numerical values up from an array we will be able to find the value.

For the project blossom we have this as our description:

The language of the flowers has a long history and has often been a topic resigned to the domain of dusty books in a thrift bookseller or a library. With Blossom, we want to give people lightning fast access to all of the possible meanings of their favorite flowers.

In this project, we are going to implement a hash map to relate the names of flowers to their meanings. In order to avoid collisions when our hashing function collides the names of two flowers, we are going to use separate chaining. We will implement the Linked List data structure for each of these separate chains.

Files:

* hash_maps.py - material about hashmap that I have done
* blossom.py
